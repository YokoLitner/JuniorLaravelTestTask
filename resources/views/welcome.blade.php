            This is enough to test basic knowledge. This simple project will help determine the quality of junior programmer's knowledge and see his practical skills. Successful completion of such a test will help to understand that in front of me is a person who has knowledge:

            MVC - Model View Controller
            Authentication
            CRUD and resource controllers
            Eloquent and foreign key communications
            Migrations and siders
            Request validation
            File Management
            Pagination
            Most basic web applications contain a functional core consisting of the listed components. Even an average project does not end there, more in-depth knowledge of technology is required. However, this is a base without which it is impossible to implement anything sensible. And, if the visiting programmer is confused even in these basic elements, then it is better to finish the conversation as soon as possible and conduct an ignoramus.

            As a result, it will be an excellent test of the ability to solve typical tasks and create simple projects. And then, all that is required from such a frame is practice, practice, and practice. Getting a hand on new projects, each of which, individually, a drop at a time, will pump the programmer's skill, making him an increasingly valuable personnel unit.

            Programming is a creative activity. People write code in different ways, some write routes everywhere Route::get, Route::post, instead of using resource. Some do not validate requests, do not use the tools of the framework, and crutches themselves, some do not use migrations, etc.
            And it is precisely this type of interview that will allow you to identify the person you need at an early stage by his code. The devil is in the details, b
